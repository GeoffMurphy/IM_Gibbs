# Bayesian component separation and power spectrum estimation for 21cm intensity mapping data cubes

An example notebook for the results of Murphy et al. (in prep.). For the given data cube, use Gibbs sampling and Gaussian Constrained Realisations to separate the foreground and 21 cm signal. With there being a total of ~3 million free parameters, sampling proceeds at around 20 seconds per iteration (wow!).
